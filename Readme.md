## Raft

This is a Rust based implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm. It is not production ready, I am using it as a learning exercise.

This is an implementation based on the blog posts by Eli Bendersky, which can be found [here](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/implementing-raft-part-0-introduction/).
